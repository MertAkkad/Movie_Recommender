# Movie Recommender Project
## Ask what kind of a movie you want and get movie recommendations.




## Overview
The Movie Recommender project is a web application designed to help users discover movies based on their text prompts. By leveraging natural language processing techniques and efficient similarity search algorithms, the application provides users with relevant movie recommendations.
*** This project is created on linux OS ***

## How It Works
The Movie Recommender operates through the following steps:

1. **User Input**: Users enter a text prompt in the input field and submit the form.
2. **Form Submission**: A POST request is sent to the Flask backend with the user's input.
3. **Processing Input**: The backend processes the input using Sentence-BERT (SBERT) to convert the text prompt into a vector representation.
4. **Querying the Database**: The vector representation is then used to query a movie database. FAISS is employed to perform efficient similarity searches, allowing the application to quickly find movies that are semantically similar to the user's input.
5. **Returning Results**: The results are returned to the frontend, where they are displayed to the user in a structured format.

## Key Technologies
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python, used for building the backend.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **SBERT**: A modification of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model that is specifically designed for generating sentence embeddings. It allows the application to understand the semantic meaning of user prompts and convert them into vector representations.
- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It enables the application to quickly find and retrieve movies that are similar to the user's input based on the embeddings generated by SBERT.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main files and directories:
- `Embedding_Generator.py`: Generates Sbert embeddings of the movie dataset and saves them into .npz file for later use.
- `Faiss_Vornoi_Generator`: Initializes Faiss index and clusterizes the embedding vector space for efficient similarity search.
- `Find_Movies.py`: This is where the faiss searching method is called(Written separately for organization purposes). 
- `web_app.py`: The main Flask application file that handles routing and logic.
- `templates/index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.


## Installation
To run the Movie Recommender project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-Recommender.git
   cd movie-Recommender
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Generate the Embeddings(** Make sure that the created .npz file has the same name as the .npz being loaded in Faiss_vorinoi_Generator **):
   ```bash
   python Embediing_Generator.py
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python web_app.py
   ```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Conclusion
The Movie Recommender project demonstrates a simple yet effective way to leverage web technologies, natural language processing, and efficient similarity search algorithms for movie discovery. By combining Flask with SBERT and FAISS, users can easily find movies that match their interests based on textual prompts.
